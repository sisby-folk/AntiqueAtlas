Press **[M]** at any time to bring up a stylized world map screen.<br/>
Drag the map to pan, scroll to zoom, and use the bookmark buttons to create and remove waypoints.

**AA4 has _absolutely no items!_** - This means the map works right away, can't be lost, and works on any server!

## Client-Side Features
- Antique Atlas 4 is designed to let you focus on exploring the world, not get stuck staring at the map!
  - The map is rendered using hand-drawn "tiles" to represent terrain, biomes, and structures.
  - Tiles represent entire chunks at least - no peeking for caves or bases!
- Gravestones automatically appear where you die, with customizable flavour text:

- Waypoint markers come in a variety of styles:

If you need an equally distraction-free compass to substitute a minimap, try [PicoHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/picohud)!

## Mixed-Side Features

_These work in singleplayer, or on servers with [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) installed._

- Markers are automatically added for notable structures and active nether portals:

- Structures only appear on the map after you've looked at them or stood on them in-game:
> ![structure discovery](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/86054c7949fed59341cef60d0d9f27aee86ae6ef.gif)
- Map exploration can be shared with `/surveyor share [player]` which will also reveal those players' position:

## Configuration

Antique Atlas can be configured from `config/antique-atlas.toml`:<br/>

> `fullscreen` can be disabled to lock the size of the map screen based on your GUI scale.<br/>
> `mapScale` can be adjusted to change the effective GUI scale of the tiles on the map.<br/>
> `structureMarkers` can be edited to toggle markers for structures - this is populated at runtime.<br/>
> `graveStyle` will change the icon and tooltip for player graves - try each out to suit your pack's aesthetics.<br/>

Further options, including options for map sharing & visibility, are documented in `config/surveyor.toml`

## Resource Packs
Tiles, markers, biome detection, and structure detection is fully data-driven via resource packs.<br/>
**Without defined biomes, atlas "guesses" tiles via tags, and shows `???` if that fails.**

For a how-to on AA4 resource packs, check out the [resource pack tutorial](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/wiki/Resource-Packs).

To automatically mark non-structure points of interest - instead use Surveyor's Landmark API, as in [Surveystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveystones).

## Version History

This is a loveletter rewrite. We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>
`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>
`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>
`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>

Once stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))

## Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

The art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>
[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.

This mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>
We can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.

We're open to better ways to implement our mods. If you see something odd and have an idea, let us know!
